<p>This show didn't create any global mega-stars like friends did (apart from the seperate rap success of Donald Glover) but the unbridled chemistry between each and every one of them is the beating heart of every episode.</p>
<p>It is immediately obvious in every scene how much these actors loved going to set and working with each other, which makes every interaction so much more enjoyable.
<p>The cast bounce off each other so naturally and they each commit to their roles whole heartedly so you never feel anything less than their complete dedication to show, which makes it a lot easier to immerse yourself in the setting as a fan.</p>

<p>We all know that sitcoms, although great, have become extremely formulaic in the last 20 years. You have the will they/wont they, you have all these beautiful charming people becoming the perfect and flawless versions of themselves and you have the same architypes and plots popping up in every show.</p>
<p>Thanks to its creator Community takes a powerful pride in suberting these stale tropes, at first it seems like the show will follow along these tropes but it quickly becomes apparent that Dan Harmon has no interest in these well worn ideas.</p>
<p>The show has no typical love triangle to cause pointless drama, forget will they/wont they the most passionate relationship in the show is the plantonic bond between two nerds. Typically if the show is using a common trope then it will call it out before the viewer can and find some way to twist the setting.</p>

<br>
<p>One of the most noticable aspects of Dan Harmon's work whether it be Community or Rick and Morty is that the man clearly loves genre, he can't help himself but to throw in a homage or two to basically any genre or setting you can imagine.</p>
<p>From mafia movies, Star Wars and post apocolyptic stylings to musicals, clip shows and even some christmas stop-motion animation. Community has one-of-a-kind episodes for anyone, and they never once give less than 100% to the genre they are embodying.</p>
<p>Make no mistake this is not references for the sake of references (cough, big bang theory) because every genre episode knows that the most important thing is to not get caught up in the style of what you are making and keep the characters front and center. Every genre episode stems from some character flaw or motivation so it never feels like references for the sake of references.</p>
<P>P.s. The first Community paintball episode is how the Russo Brothers got chosen to direct MCU projects such as Winter Soldier, Infinity War and End Game.</P>

<br>
<p>As previously mentioned the cast do a phenomenal job but one major thing helping them is some of the best writing ever used for a sitcom. The shows writing flows so perfectly from joke to joke with peak efficiency.</p>
<p>The show is so good at taking an ensemble cast of different characters and having them all interact in a free-flowing scene with jokes flowing so easily whilst balancing the ongoing plots.</p>
